# imdBReactApp
an imdB application based on Reactjs

### Day 1 (08 Dec 2020 - Tuesday):

- Today received assignment to create an imdB app based on Reactjs using Components and API calls
- I started thinking the React way (i.e., components based thinking, simply, breaking the UI into components hierarcy)
- Made a sample sketch of the app on a blank sheet in my own way
- Did some R(esearch) on APIs, Filters, Axios api call.
- By the EOD, implemented basic UI design for the app creating my first component and used CSS Grid mainly

*Here are the results:*

**Note:** *Daily Progress Code Snippets are there in the ExperimentalCode directory.*

###### Any Doubts for the day:
- I was quite wondering what kind of components to create (class or function) as of now (using useState hooks) both gives quite the same results


### Day 2 (09 Dec 2020 - Wednesday):

- Started working on the individual components
